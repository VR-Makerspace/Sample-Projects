# VRNM-Assets

This repository is used to house assets that users of VRNM may access and use.

All assets here are royalty free or are licensed under some version of Creative Commons. This means that you do not have to pay to use these assets, although you have to give credit to the authors and creators of each asset.

Each asset should be within a folder that has either a text file or a URL that directs to the source of the asset. Please use these files to provide credit in your A-Frame projects. One way of doing so is to credit the authors within comments that can be made in your main .html document.
